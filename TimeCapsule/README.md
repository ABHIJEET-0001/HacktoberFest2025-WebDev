# Time Capsule — Messages to Your Future Self

> A mini web app to write messages for your future self and unlock them on a chosen date and time.

---

## Concept
Write a personal message, choose a **date and time**, and let time do the rest.  
Your message remains locked until your chosen day — then it unlocks with a reveal animation.  
You can also **edit**, **discard**, or **stop** a message after it unlocks.
